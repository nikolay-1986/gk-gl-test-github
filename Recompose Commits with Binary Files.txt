Steps for testing:
Select commits that include binary file changes
Open via 'Recompose Selected Commits'
Review in Composer
Attempt to recompose
Expected result:
Composer loads commits successfully
Binary files shown with appropriate indicator (e.g., 'Binary file changed')
AI recompose handles binary files gracefully (skips or notes them)
No errors or crashes
